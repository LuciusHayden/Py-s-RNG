Hello, my name is Lucius, I made this in imitation of a popular Roblox game called Sol's RNG, its basically just a random number generator in which you roll for different things. The game is quite boring however its unbelievably popular on Roblox. I will add a few more features but this game is in preparation for a game I plan on making soon in collaboration with another person. I also have a youtube channel in which I post some tutorials and videos about my projects.
